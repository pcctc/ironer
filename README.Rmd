# Installation

You can install the current development version of {ironer} from [GitHub](https://github.com/pcctc/ironer). 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pcctc/ironer")
```

# Introduction

The goal of {ironer} is to provide a convenience functions and documentation 
for wrangling data from the IRONMAN registry <https://ironmanregistry.org/>. 

If anything is unclear or could use updating, please file an [issue](https://github.com/pcctc/ironer/issues) in this
repository, or contact the PCCTC data science team at <zzpdl_pcctc_data_science@mskcc.org>.


# Included

## Articles

1. Medidata data documentation

2. PROMS data documentation

3. Line of therapy algorithm

4. Treatment mapping


## Functions

* `assign_lot()` is the function used to assign line of therapy. Researchers may
find this useful to apply to their own data set. Please review the Line of Therapy
vignette for caveats and usage.

* `assign_baseline_metastatic()` is a function used internally at PCCTC to create the 
derived baseline metastatic variables in the subject table (`is_metastatic_baseline`, 
`origin_metastatic_baseline`, `date_metastatic_baseline`). As this information is available
in the curated data, we do not see this as of particular use to researchers. However
those interested in how this assignment is derived may be interested to review the source
code. 




## Data

The data in the {ironer} package is in progress and subject to change.

* `dictionary_medidata` Data dictionary of clinical data recorded in medidata. Subject to change.
The data consists of multiple tables.

* `dictionary_proms` is a data set of the data dictionary of Patient Reported Outcomes and Measures (PROMS) self-report survey data. 
The survey consists of multiple instruments. Some instruments also have multiple versions.
Subject to change..

* `treatment_map` represents the treatment mappings from the original raw data to 
standardized & recoded treatment assignments. If a mapping needs to be corrected or added,
please file an issue or contact PCCTC. Note that this mapping should already
be in the `priorrx_derived` and `treatment_derived` tables.
