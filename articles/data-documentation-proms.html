<p>Demographic questions were asked across two different instruments
(<code>irondemog</code> and <code>irondemog_v3</code>). Due to the
common usage of race/ethnicity, these questions were combined from the
two instruments for analysis convenience. These are noted in the
<code>irondemog combined</code> instrument, as well as in the medidata
<code>subject</code> table.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>race.26.x</code> (a select all question, where
<code>x</code> indicates the numeric select all option)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>race.26.1</code> coalesces values from
<code>irondemog.26.1</code> and <code>irondemog_v3.26.1</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>race.26.2</code> coalesces values from
<code>irondemog.26.2</code> and <code>irondemog_v3.26.2</code></p></li>

<p>Survey respondents were asked height and weight in a two part
question. First, they enter the numeric value of height and weight, and
second the enter the unit of measurement (inches/cm or pounds/kg). These
measurements have been kept in separate variables according to the the
unit indicated. Note that these are also in two different instruments,
and should be coalesced for analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>irondemog.3.1</code>, <code>irondemog_v3.3.1</code>: height
in inches</p></li>
<li><p><code>irondemog.3.2</code>, <code>irondemog_v3.3.2</code>: height
in cm</p></li>
<li><p><code>irondemog.5.1</code>, <code>irondemog_v3.5.1</code>: weight

<li><p><code>irondemog.5.2</code>, <code>irondemog_v3.5.2</code>: weight
in kg</p></li>

</h2>
<p><strong>1. For FACT-FPSI, are there only 2 questions recorded
(<code>factfpsi_1</code> and <code>factfpsi_2</code>)?</strong></p>
<p>Confirmed in data set and protocol that only 2 questions are
collected.</p>
<p><strong>2. For BPI, one two questions were found.
(<code>ironmisc_12</code> and <code>ironmisc_13</code> or
<code>ironmisc_v5_15</code> and <code>ironmisc_v5_16</code>). Please
advise on how to process them.</strong></p>
<p>The responses should be combined across the two protocol versions to
get a complete set.</p>
<p><strong>3. Why does <code>ironmisc</code> not have an indication of
questionnaire name? </strong></p>
<p><code>ironmisc</code> questions are miscellaneous questions not part
of a formal instrument; they are presented to patients as “How you feel,
your memory, sleep quality, and pain”.</p>
