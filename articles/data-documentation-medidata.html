<p>When possible, treatment regimens are mapped to standardized coding

by identifying not yet mapped treatments and then personnel researching
the drug class, which is confirmed and QCâ€™d by medical monitors when in
question. The treatment mapping is continuously updated.</p>
<p>Standardized treatment mapping is contained in
<code>ca_cm_derived</code>. These two tables contain all information in
the original <code>ca_cm</code> table, and additionally provides:</p>

<li><p><code>treatment_lower</code>: entry in lower case</p></li>

<p>There are 6 computed / derived Gleason scores. In general, gleason
scores consist of</p>
<ul>
<li><p>gleason 1 (max value 5)</p></li>
<li><p>gleason 2 (max value 5)</p></li>
<li><p>gleason sum (max value 10)</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>if both gleason 1 and gleason 2 are less than or equal to five,
the total gleason score is the sum of the two</p></li>
<li><p>if the first gleason score is greater than five, the total
gleason score is taken to be the first gleason score</p></li>

<p>In the instance that a table has multiple gleason scores per subject
(e.g., on study biopsy), the largest gleason score sum is carried
