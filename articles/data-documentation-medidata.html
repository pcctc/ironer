<p>When possible, treatment regimens are mapped to standardized coding

by identifying not yet mapped treatments and then personnel researching
the drug class, which is confirmed and QC’d by medical monitors when in
question. The treatment mapping is continuously updated.</p>
<p>Standardized treatment mapping is contained in
<code>ca_cm_derived</code>. These two tables contain all information in
the original <code>ca_cm</code> table, and additionally provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>treatment_lower</code>: entry in lower case</p></li>

<p>There are 6 computed / derived Gleason scores. In general, gleason
scores consist of</p>
<ul>
<li><p>gleason 1 (max value 5)</p></li>
<li><p>gleason 2 (max value 5)</p></li>
<li><p>gleason sum (max value 10)</p></li>

<ul>

the total gleason score is the sum of the two</p></li>

gleason score is taken to be the first gleason score</p></li>
