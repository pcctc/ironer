</h3>
<p>When possible, treatment regimens are mapped to standardized coding through a a master treatment mapping file. This master list is created by identifying not yet mapped treatments and then personnel researching the drug class, which is confirmed and QCâ€™d by medical monitors when in question. The treatment mapping is continuously updated.</p>
<p>Standardized treatment mapping is contained in <code>priorrx_derived</code> and <code>treatment_derived</code>. These two tables contain all information in the original <code>priorrx</code> and <code>treatment</code> tables, and additionally provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>priorrxreg_lower</code>, <code>treatment_lower</code>: entry in lower case</p></li>
<li><p><code>priorrx_treatment_recode</code>, <code>trt_treatment_recode</code>: assigned standardized coding</p></li>
<li><p><code>priorrx_treatment_category</code>, <code>trt_treatment_category</code>: assigned treatment category</p></li>
<li><p><code>priorrx_is_taxel</code>, <code>trt_is_taxel</code>: treatment is one of Cabazitaxel, Docetaxel, Paclitaxel, Tesetaxel</p></li>
<li><p><code>priorrx_is_nha</code>, <code>trt_is_nha</code> : treatment is a novel hormonal agent (one of Abiraterone, Enzalutamide, Darolutamide, Apalutamide)</p></li>

<h3 id="gleason-scores-derived-variables">Gleason scores (derived variables)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#gleason-scores-derived-variables"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are 6 computed / derived Gleason scores. In general, gleason scores consist of</p>
<ul>
<li><p>gleason 1 (max value 5)</p></li>
<li><p>gleason 2 (max value 5)</p></li>
<li><p>gleason sum (max value 10)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, sites occasionally enter the Gleason sum in either of the first Gleason scores. In the cleaned derived Gleason scores</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if both gleason 1 and gleason 2 are less than or equal to five, the total gleason score is the sum of the two</p></li>
<li><p>if the first gleason score is greater than five, the total gleason score is taken to be the first gleason score</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the instance that a table has multiple gleason scores per subject (e.g., on study biopsy), the largest gleason score sum is carried forward to the subject table.</p>
